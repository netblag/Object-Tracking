# Object-Tracking
This Python script uses OpenCV's CamShift algorithm for real-time object tracking in a video stream. Users interactively select an object by defining a bounding box through mouse clicks. The program continuously tracks and highlights the chosen object, offering a straightforward and interactive tracking experience.
